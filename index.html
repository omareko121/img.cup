        <h2>Objectives</h2>
        <p>Vision 2030, through its axis related to the vital community, seeks to preserve our environment and rationalize the use of Our natural resources through the optimal use of our water resources, as the National Water Company works on Reduce actual losses from water networks and commercial losses. - The Kingdom's interest in artificial intelligence technologies has also increased in recent years, <br> as it seeks to raise the size of Targeted investments in the Saudi artificial intelligence sector to 80 billion riyals by 2030 The Kingdom seeks to raise the number of companies working in data and artificial intelligence to 400 companies by 2030, which paints a bright picture of this sector. Due to the need for high energy to operate, desalination works on reverse osmosis techniques. Take advantage of saline feedback and work to reduce the effects of energy with fossil fuels</p>

        <h2>Problem</h2>
        <p>‏- From this point of view, we aim in this project to employ artificial intelligence and the Internet of Things ‏To serve productive water desalination strategies and raise their efficiency in order to reduce waste and economic cost ‏- Our project also aims to automate it with water networks and optimize the investment of energy and reduce its environmental impacts ‏And seeking to reduce the percentage of pollution resulting from the high energy used for production ‏- As for the energy consumed for production, the problem is how to supply it with carbon capture technology ‏Storage, recycling and water loss of more than 20% ‏According to the latest statistics ‏After the research team visited the branch of the Ministry of Water in the region, we found out the high cost of transporting water from the stations Desalination to its destination in Al-Baha and Taif, which extends through the longest water pipeline in the world along 800 km and a capacity of 1.3 million m^3 per day It was also surprising to the team that the cost of transporting them from desalination plants Until it reaches the user, it consumes high energy in addition to the percentage of water loss among the product from Desalination plants and the connection to its destination in the areas of Al-Baha and Taif, and after communicating with the desalination, it was found The very high cost when running desalination plants using clean energy this motivated the team to work to minimize the impact of the use of fossil fuels Through this, the research team crystallized the following question: First: How effective is the use of artificial intelligence techniques in reducing the percentage of losses in water networks? ( Integration Strategy - Added Value ) Second: Can the effects of carbon dioxide resulting from energy consumption, storage and recycling be reduced?</p>

        <h2>Results</h2>

        <p>The data showed reducing water loss through pipes according to the treatment used and significant feasibility Statistics in reducing the material cost when employing the Internet of Things in water transport operations. ‏The added value provided by innovation is to make water systems more efficient by reducing the proportion of ‏Loss below 15% ‏Answer every question ‏The service provided by the National Water Company is a smart monitoring system for water networks within cities and villages ‏And detect leaks and treat them early, as the process of repairing pipes and detecting leaks to reduce the percentage of ‏Water losses face some difficulties ‏Another added value offered by innovation is the study of carbon dioxide capture and storage technologies. ‏and recycled ‏Answer every question ‏The service provided to the energy sector is the study of absorbent DAC technologies to optimize the storage process of 2CO where ‏There is still a lot of room to improve adjuvant sorbents to reduce the effects of fuel pollution ‏Fossil Energy Production ‏What is the added value provided by innovation that makes it different from similar innovations and achieves it ‏Market competition ‏Answer every question ‏What service will you provide to the customer that meets his needs? ‏What are the problems in products similar to innovation and how innovation overcame them, such as (price, ‏Easy access, ease of use, convenient, warranty, after-sales services, .....</p>
